# ScrollyTelling
 A sample project that uses vertical scrolling to show text, and advance a timeline. This is to create a Scrollytelling effect to explain a story with text and animation similar to what the NY Times did for this [Antartica](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/13/climate/antarctic-climate-change.html) article.
